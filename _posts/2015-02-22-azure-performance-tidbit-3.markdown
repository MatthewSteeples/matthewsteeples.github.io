Just a short one today. Ran a larger query on the dataset that I've been querying recently, and generated a 120mb Excel file containing 1.4 million rows in less than 24 minutes. Average speed there (end to end) of 965 records per second.

Now just working on getting the UI in place and I can ship this!
