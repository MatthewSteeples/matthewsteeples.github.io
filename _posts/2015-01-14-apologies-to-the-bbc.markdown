It turns out (about 6 hours before my licence cancellation was actioned) that the BBC have decided that I am in the UK, and the reason that they thought I initially wasn't in the UK was actually partially my fault!

I'd been experimenting with a technology called Tor, which is designed to allow you to browse the web anonymously, and one of it's uses (which hadn't occurred to me at the time) is that you can browse the web as if you were in a different country. Obviously BBC content is only available in the UK, and this technology can be used to pretend that you're in the UK when in fact you're not.

So I'll put my hands up and take responsibility for that, and I'm pleased to say that everything is back up and running now!
