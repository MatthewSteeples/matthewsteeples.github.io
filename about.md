I graduated from the University of Hull in 2007 with a First Class Honours degree in Software Engineering. After graduation I spent three years working for a software house as part of a multidisciplinary team delivering both small- and large-scale projects. This was followed by a period of self-employment where I worked with a variety of customers on a freelance basis, both developing brand new software and expanding existing systems.

Since 2011 I have been technical director for [Ledgerscope](https://ledgerscope.com) a start-up company developing accounting software, with sole responsibility for everything from architecture decisions to writing code to maintaining and modifying the live system.

My work has given me experience of developing software right through from the initial brief to delivery of the finished product both alone and as part of a team. I am also an active participant in open source and professional developer forums which I find invaluable for keeping my skills up-to-date.
