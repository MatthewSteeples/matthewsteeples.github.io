I don't plan on writing much about politics on here, but it seems like it's such an important aspect of life to be involved with that I can't ignore it entirely. The UK is currently in frenzied turmoil about leaving the European Union. I'm not going to pretend that I know what the right answer is, I just know what I believe.

One thing that has always annoyed me about politics (and politicians) is the "us and them" mentality. There's very rarely any unity going on. This divide then leads to always having to be right, while never acknowledging what the "other side" are saying. Take Brexit as an example: one side is saying what's bad about leaving, the other is saying what's bad about staying. Both of them are trying to persuade us that their ideals are not only right, but flawless. There's no balance or mention of compromise, and if you disagree with any of them or ask questions, you're just not listening! 

Neither option is without its drawbacks, and the magnitude of the consequences of either choice are far too large for individuals to comprehend. The public got "bored" of "experts" in the run up to the referendum. Let that sink in for a second: the single biggest decision that the entire country has ever been asked to make is looming, and we don't want anyone to give us advice, we'd rather just wing it!

> To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
> To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job

Politicians are meant to represent the people in their constituency. Usually this gets slimmed down to representing just the people that voted for them, and then it gets slimmed down even further as it also needs to align with their party. "Career politicians" will, in a lot of cases, do what it takes to stay in power, even if it goes against what they believe or what most people would consider right. They'll criticise everything and everyone else, and hope people have got a short memory when it comes to their own achievements or decisions.

Aren't they all on the same side? Come to think of it, aren't we all on the same side? I'm assuming no one in government or the population actually wants our country to descend into chaos or poverty? If that's the case, then why is it impossible to get a straight answer out of any of them!
